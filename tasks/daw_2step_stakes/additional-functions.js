	"<div align=justify>While the chance an alien has treasure to share changes over time, it changes slowly. So an alien with a good treasure mine right now will stay good for a while.<br><br>To find the alien with the best mine at each point in time, you must concentrate.</div>",

	"<div align=justify>Lets's practice before doing the full game. Here are a few hints before you start: <br><br>Hint #1:<br>Remember which aliens have treasure. How good a mine is changes slowly, so an alien that has a lot of treasure to share now will be very likely to share with you in the near future.<br><br>Hint #2:<br>Remember, each alien has its own mine. Just because one alien has a bad mine, does not mean another has a good mine. Also, there are no funny patterns in how likely it is that an alien shares treasure with you, like every other time you ask, or depending on which spaceship you took. The aliens are not tricking you.<br><br>Hint #3:<br>The spaceship you choose is important because often the alien on one planet is better than the ones on another planet. You can find more treasure by finding the spaceship that takes you to the right planet.</div>",

At the beginning that won't seem like very much time and you may find the task difficult. Over time, as you learn to play, you will find that 1.5 seconds is enough time to make good decisions.<br><br>Our advice is to think carefully about your strategy, but also to trust your instincts. By concentrating you can increase the number of points you win by a lot. There is an element of chance, but a lot of room for skill as well.<br><br>Now, you will do 40 practice trials.
